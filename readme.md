# Calendar Overview EInk

The project shows the current day calendar view on a 3.7 inch e-paper screen using a Raspberry Pico W. It will need to download the `.ics` file and preprocess it to be readable using basic python(so that it can run in micropython). 

 - [ ] Parse ICS calendar file to OOP
 - [ ] Use basic API for the weather and time function
 - [ ] Print information to the screen
 - [ ] Develop a UI for the web also
